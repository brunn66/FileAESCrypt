Building on linux
= Build prerequisites =
x86 or x86_64 Linux based OS (any distro and/or architecture capable of building crypto++ should work)
Crypto++ development(header)-files
Crypto++ libraries (static linking is strongly recommended)

= Building =
make linux32-dbg linux32 linux64-dbg linux64
will build all (dbg,rel,32,64) linux binaries, simply remove those targets you dont want.
